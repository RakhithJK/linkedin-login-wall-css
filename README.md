# Description

Some code for removing the login wall and scroll freeze when browsing more than
one profile on LinkedIn without needing to log in.

JavaScript can be pasted into the console to remove the login wall and scroll
freeze.

uBlock Origin filter lines can be added via uBlock Origin Settings > My filters.

If you don't use Google Chrome, your browser generally is capable of attaching
custom user stylesheets.

I **DON'T** recommend using
[Stylish](https://userstyles.org/)
due to privacy concerns since it is now
connected with an analytics tracking company. However, if you are a Stylish
user I've created a stylesheet that can be attached/installed [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/153015/remove-linkedin-login-wall).
